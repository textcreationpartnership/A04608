            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:20078:11"/>
three ≈øeueral points to be this. Fir≈øt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtle doth enter into a cour≈øe of ≈øchooling the poore man ≈øhewing him by direction, with what minde he is to take, and to beare the cro≈ø≈øe of his pouertie and howe to behaue him≈øelfe in the ≈øtate and time of his low de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree: that is, he is not to fire his eyes, and to looke onely vpon the vilene≈ø≈øe, and ba≈øene≈ø≈øe of his condition, and to dwell ≈øtill vpon the con≈øideration of his pinching nece≈ø≈øities, but he is to take another, and better cour≈øe, namely to erecte and lifte vp his minde in ≈øome heauenly meditation, to take as it were a ≈øpirituall view of that immortall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, and cele≈øtiall po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, wherein he ≈øhal be ioyned partener with al the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and children of God, if he practi≈øe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation, patience, obedience, &amp; godlines in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cour≈øe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ≈øimple life, whereby it plea≈øeth God for a time to try &amp; to humble him.

<pb facs="tcp:20078:12"/>
but he is to know that as his life is vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, ≈øo is his riches, fora≈ømuch as the Lord giueth both, and taketh both away at his plea≈øure: ≈øo that he is not to ware proud or to growe arrogant, vpon the ta≈øt and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the felicitie of this life, but rather to be meekly ≈øpirited, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time of his greate≈øt flori≈øhing, as knowing that although he be now at this pre≈øent in much pro≈øperitie, &amp; hoy≈øed vp to the top and mount of good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, yet he may ≈øuddenly be turned downe to mi≈øerie, and ≈øtript of all that now he po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øe≈ø≈øeth. Thirdly, and la≈øtly, lea≈øt the Apo≈øtle ≈øhould ≈øeeme to ≈øpeak this without his war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and euidence, he doth in the latter parte of the tenthe ver≈øe, produce a rea≈øon as an amplification of the doctrine, to fortifie his a≈ø≈øertion withall, which is done by way of ≈øimilitude con≈øi≈øting of the qualitie and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur of a common flower of the gra≈ø≈øe, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øenting the weake ≈øtate, and ≈øhort durance of humane pro≈øperitie: then which flower ye know your ≈øelues there is nothing more mutable, and ≈øubiect to a change, by rea≈øon of the ≈ømall force, and ≈øub≈øtance that it hath to abide, and ≈øtand, in his beautie: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it ≈øpread it ≈øelfe gloriou≈øly in the morning, and ≈øeeme to be the thing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb facs="tcp:20078:12"/>
nature hath labored to ≈øhew all her ≈økill, yet the heate of the ≈øunne when it ri≈øeth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermatcheth the glorie thereof, and makes it quickly to wither, and come to nothing. Such is the rich man, and his riches. So that by this onely diui≈øion, and re≈øolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> of the ver≈øes ye may well conceiue what no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and nece≈ø≈øary matter is lodged and contayned in them. Being ≈øuch, as doth concerne all e≈øtates, and re≈øpect all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, high and lowe, rich and poore, the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble per≈øonage and the poore≈øt cotager, all and euery one may herehence learne a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection for his life, and furni≈øh his minde with a ≈øufficient trea≈øure of in≈øtructions, how &amp; after what maner to di≈øpo≈øe of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe, and his doings in the be≈øt ≈øort to the glorie of God, and the euerla≈øting comfort of his ≈øoule. The poore man becau≈øe of his wants and defectes is not to de≈øpaire: the rich man by rea≈øon of his aboundance, and fuperfluities is not to pre≈øume of him≈øelfe, and his abilitie: the honorable is to temper his high degree with humblene≈ø≈øe of minde, the Iazar or mi≈øerable creature, to mitigate, and qualifie his ≈ømart by the v≈øe of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as hereafter in the proce≈ø≈øe of our ≈øpeech yee ≈øhall ≈øee, by the grace of God,

more at large.</p>
               <p>Concerning therfore the fir≈øt of our parts, although the Apo≈øtles phra≈øe be here ≈øingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, ≈øeeming to ≈øpeake of ≈øome ≈øpecial or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler per≈øon, yet by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ferring other places with it of the ≈øame forme of wordes, and by con≈øidering the reach of the doctrine to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend generally to all, I doubt not but they are plurally to be taken, and con≈øerued.

his words.<note place="margin">Iames. 4.11.</note> And our Apo≈øtle <hi>Iames</hi> will haue vs in no ca≈øe to ≈øpeake euil one of another. A third matter there is al≈øo in the≈øe wordes, which is not to be omitted without note and ob≈øeruation, namely that in the Apo≈øtles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections heere to the poore man, and in the v≈øe of his name, he doth not cal him the poore brother, or beggerly brother, but the brother of low degree, although in ≈øo doing it may ≈øeeme that part of his meaning is to increa≈øe and magnifie the glorious exaltation of ≈øuch a man to the kingdome of God, which by a compari≈øon made with a precedent ba≈øenes, is made ≈øo much the more high and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, by how much the more low and ≈øimple his condition was before in the world, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe that contrary things being one ≈øet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt another, are then mo≈øt cleerely and perfectly ≈øeen what they are, yet I doubt not but that the commodities of the low e≈øtate of a poore man, are heere in≈øinnuated, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded by the v≈øe of the phra≈øe: for the low degree of a man, although it bee accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with ≈øome wants in re≈øpecte of the abundance of the richer ≈øorte, who are commonly de≈øtitute of nothing ≈øeruing to the outward pro≈øperitie of this life, yet it is free from tho≈øe hazardes, and perilles,
<pb facs="tcp:20078:17"/>
whereunto the hygh e≈øtate of the welthy is continually ≈øubiecte. For they may in good ≈øen≈øe bee compared to hyghe trees ≈øcituated and planted in the toppes of mountayns, which by rea≈øon of their place lye open to euery winde that bloweth, and euery ≈øtorme that ary≈øeth, yea a little puffe of the ayre maketh them to ≈øhake, and to tremble: but the poorer ≈øorte are with good probabilitie re≈øembled to lowe ≈øhrubbes, or bu≈øhes growing in the vallies vnder the winges, and defence of the hilles, which by rea≈øon of their lowe growth, are ≈øafe from the raging ≈øtorme, and beating tempe≈øt, they are not a≈ø≈øaulted with the feercene≈ø≈øe of euery whirlewinde, they are not beaten with the droppes of euery ≈øcouring ≈øhowre, they ≈øtand and ≈øpring in quiet, and ≈øafetye, when the highe Cedars mu≈øt needes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue euery wether, and refu≈øe none, and therefore are many times by contrary and furious windes rent and torne, and ≈øo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented of further increa≈øe.
